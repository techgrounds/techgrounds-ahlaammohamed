Afterward, I changed the alias name to "mijndemo-test" using the dashboard. 
 An alias name is used to create a user-friendly and easy-to-remember URL for accessing the AWS Management Console login page.

In the top-right corner, you can observe that the new user is logged in and identified as an IAM user:
