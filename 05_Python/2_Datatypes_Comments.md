# Data types and Comments

## Introductions 
Programming languages make use of data types to tell the computer how to interpret those strings. 

This is a non-exhaustive list of some of the most important data types in Python:


**boolean**

A binary state that is either True or False.
boolean = True

**String**

Technically an array of characters. Strings are denoted using “ ” double quotes or ‘ ’ single quotes.
string = "This is a string"

**Int**

An integer is a whole number. Ints can be both positive and negative.
integer = 6

**Float**

A floating-point number is a decimal number.
floating_point = 18.5

Comments are lines that do not get processed as code. This can be used for multiple purposes. For example, you can write a short description of what a block of code does. You can also ‘comment out’ some code, so that it is temporarily removed. This can be useful for testing and debugging.

## Results
**Exercise 4:** Create a new script.
Copy the code below into your script.
a = 'int'

b = 7

c = False

d = "18.5"

Determine the data types of all four variables ( a, b, c, d) using a built-in function.
Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

Exercise 5: Create a new script.
Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
