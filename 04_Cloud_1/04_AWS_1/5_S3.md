# S3
## Introduction
AWS offers object based storage in the form of S3. S3 makes use of buckets as a container for objects. A single object in S3 has a maximum size of 5TB. However, the total size of a bucket is virtually unlimited.

Bucket names must be globally unique. That is, even other AWS accounts in different regions cannot share the same bucket name. Buckets, and objects within buckets, can be accessed using a URL.


The bucket policy acts as an access control list. Data can be encrypted for even further protection.


Objects are automatically replicated within a region, so that there’s always at least three copies available. This redundancy greatly increases the availability and durability of objects stored in S3.
Storage classes differ in availability, durability, retrieval time, and cost.

In S3, you pay for:

GBs storage per month
Transfer OUT to out of the region
PUT, COPY, POST, LIST, and GET requests
You don’t pay for:

Transfer IN to Amazon S3
Transfer OUT from S3 to CloudFront or EC2 in the same region
Besides storing data for all kinds of purposes (big data, storing videos, archiving, etc.), S3 has another use case: hosting static websites.

## Exercise
1. Create new S3 bucket with the following requirements:

- Region: Frankfurt (eu-central-1)
- Upload a cat picture to your bucket.

Share the object URL of your cat picture with a peer. 

2. Create new bucket with the following requirements:

- Region: Frankfurt (eu-central-1)
- Upload the four files that make up AWS’ demo website.

Enable static website hosting and share the bucket website endpoint with a peer. 

## Results
**Exercise 1**

I shared the object URL and my peer opened it in his browser as you can see in the screenshot above.

**Exercise 2**

I shared the bucket website endpoint and my peer opened it in his browser as you can see in the screenshot above.
