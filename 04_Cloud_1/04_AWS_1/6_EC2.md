# EC2
## Introduction
The service with which you can run Virtual Machines in AWS is called EC2. These VMs can be used for anything a regular server is used for. Since theyâ€™re located at a remote location, connecting to the machine has to be done via the internet. For a connection to Linux machines, you use the Secure Shell (ssh) protocol. For a connection to Windows machines, you use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

When creating an EC2 instance, you first need to select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI is a blueprint for your machine. It contains a template for the OS among other things.

## Exercise
**Exercise 1:** 

Launch an EC2 instance with the following requirements:
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type
- Instance type: t2.micro
- Default network, no preference for subnet
- Termination protection: enabled
- User data:
```
#!/bin/bash
yum -y install httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
echo '<h1>Hello From Your Web Server!</h1>' > /var/www/html/index.html
```

- Root volume: general purpose SSD, Size: 8 GiB
- New Security Group:
- Name: Web server SG
- Rules: Allow SSH, HTTP and HTTPS from anywhere

**Exercise 2:**

Check if the the System reachability and the Instance reachability checks have passed.

Log in to your EC2 instance using an ssh connection. After you are done terminate your instance.

## Results
**Exercise 1:**
I launched an EC2 instance with the requirements that was given for this exercise.

**Exercise 2:**
I check the system reachability and instance reachability through by viewing the Status Checks tab.

As you can see in the screenshot, the checks have passed.

To start launching my EC2 instance I used the following commands in my terminal:

```
ssh ec2-user@3.72.2.241
```
And then I continue by using the following command:
```
ssh -i /Users/ahlaammohamed/Downloads/ec2.pem ec2-user@3.72.2.241
```
I get the bad permissions warning so I do the following:

```
chmod 400 /Users/ahlaammohamed/Downloads/ec2.pem
```
Lastly I try to login again:
```
ssh -i /Users/ahlaammohamed/Downloads/ec2.pem ec2-user@3.72.2.241
```
Now I have succesfully logged in to my EC2 instance using a ssh connection.

Before I can terminate the instance I have to disable the termination protection that I set up first. After I have done that I can use the terminatation button that is under the instance state tab.
