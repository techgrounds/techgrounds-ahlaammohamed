# Shared Responsibility model

## Introduction
The Shared Responsibility Model describes who is responsible for the security of what part of the cloud. In general, you can say that AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for security in the cloud. AWS is always responsible for securing the physical infrastructure, while the customer is always responsible for encrypting customer data.
